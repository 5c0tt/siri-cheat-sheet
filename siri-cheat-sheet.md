**The Different Uses of the iPhone Home Button**

Dorothy clicked her red-sequined heels three times to go home. You only need to press the Home button once to get to the iPhone's Home screen. Pressing the Home button twice performs a couple functions, depending on where you start from, whereas pressing it three times makes your iPhone perform various Accessibility functions:

* When iPhone is sleeping: Press the Home button once to reveal the Unlock slider, the Camera button, and the playback controls (if you're listening to music or a podcast).

* When iPhone is unlocked: Press the Home button twice quickly to reveal the App Switcher and recent contacts.

* From any Home screen that isn't the first one: Press the Home button once to return to the first Home screen.

* From an app: Press the Home button once to return to the Home screen that was most recently viewed. The app remains running in the background until you close it from the App Switcher.

* Press and hold: Whether your iPhone is sleeping, locked, or awake, press and hold the Home button to summon Siri (an Internet connection is required for Siri to function) or Voice Control, if you have Siri turned off.

* Press the Home button and Sleep/Wake button simultaneously: Captures an image of the screen, known as a screenshot, and stores it in the Camera Roll of the Photos app.

* Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button simultaneously: Your iPhone will turn off without displaying the Slide to Power Off slider.

* Open the Settings app, tap General, tap Accessibility, and tap Accessibility Shortcut to activate any or all options including VoiceOver, Invert Colors, Grayscale, Zoom, Switch Control, and AssistiveTouch: When activated, triple-pressing the Home button solicits those functions.

**Tapping and Holding Buttons and Icons on Your iPhone**     
On your iPhone, if you want to open an app, fill in a text field, or choose a command such as Print or Message, you tap the appropriate icon, field, or button. Tap a phone number and iPhone asks if you want to call the number, tap a URL and Safari launches to open the web page, or tap a date or time and a menu offers to create an event or show the date or time in Calendar.

**The tap and hold gesture opens another world of commands on your iPhone:**
* Image: Tap and hold an image to see the Save Image or Copy buttons. Tap one of those options to perform that function.

* Text: Tap and hold text to see editing buttons such as Copy, Define, Select, or Select All. Tap one of the buttons to perform the function.

* Phone Number: A menu of options opens that includes Call (the number) along with Send Message (to the number), Add (the number) to Contacts, or Copy.

* Any icon on the Home screen: Tap and hold these icons until they begin to wiggle and jiggle. Then tap the X in the corner to delete the app from your iPhone or tap and drag them to a new position.

* Links in Safari: Tap and hold a link on a web page in Safari and then tap Add to Reading List to add the linked page to your Reading List without opening the link. Alternatively, tap Open to replace the page you're viewing or Open in New Tab to open the linked page in a new tab while maintaining the existing page open, or tap Copy or Save Image to perform those actions.

* On the onscreen keyboard, rather than tap and hold, you tap and slide to do the following:

* 123 key: Tap this key and without lifting it, slide your finger to the numeric digit or punctuation you want, and then let go. The number or punctuation is inserted in your text and the keyboard returns to letters, which saves you from having to tap the 123 key, tap the number you want, and then tap the 123 key again to return the keyboard to letters.

* "Dot" (.) key: Not to be confused with the period, this key appears to the left of the Go or Return key when the cursor is in an email address field or a browser's URL field. Tap and hold when typing an email or web address to open a contextual menu with other domain suffixes, such as .com, .net, . org, or .eu. Slide your finger to the domain suffix you want to use and then lift your finger.

* Letters and symbols: Tap and hold to reveal a contextual menu of accented letters or symbols. For example, tap and hold the S on the keyboard to see options for ß, ś, and š. Slide your finger to the letter or symbol you want to use; then lift your finger to insert it in the text you're typing.

**Tips on Using Siri in iPhone**    
Siri can do some pretty surprising things, and she (it?) has acquired many new skills with each new release of iOS. You can phrase the command for the same task in several ways; for example, you can ask "What time is it?" or "Tell me the time." These are some examples of the kinds of commands you can use to communicate with Siri:

* Call Barbara Boyd."
* What is Joe Hutsko's address?"
* Will it be hot in Bangkok on Thursday?"
* Please schedule a meeting with John Wiley for February 5 at 10 a.m."
* Read my text messages."
* Send a text message to my sister telling her my plane gets in at 4 p.m."
* Play Barton Hollow."
* What's the quickest way from home to the Longwood Gardens?"
* Set the timer for 45 minutes."
* What song is this?"
* Remind me to call the dentist at 11 a.m."
* What is the dollar–euro exchange rate?"
* Search for Valentine's Day cake recipes."
* Add Michel Peissel to my reading list note."
* What movies are playing in Philadelphia tonight?"
* Which films were nominated for Best Picture Oscars in 2005?"
* Buy tickets for the 8 o'clock show of Titanic at the Roxy."
* Who won the World Series in 1948?"
* What was the final score for last night's tennis match?"
